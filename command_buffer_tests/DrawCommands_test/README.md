According to the Vulkan spec:
- A valid graphics pipeline **must** be bound to the current command buffer
  with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS`
- `commandBuffer` **must** be in the recording state
- These commands **must** only be called inside of a render pass instance
- vkCmdDrawIndexed
  - `(indexSize * (firstIndex + indexCount) + offset)` **must** be less than or
  equal to the size of the currently bound index buffer, with `indexSize` being
  based on the type specified by `indexType`, where the index buffer,
  `indexType`, and `offset` are specified via `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer`
- vkCmdDrawIndirect / vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect
  - `offset` must be a multiple of 4
  - If `drawCount` is greater than 1, `stride` must be a multiple of 4 and must
  be greater than or equal to `sizeof(VkDrawIndirectCommand|VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand)`
  - If `drawCount` is equal to 1,
  `(offset + sizeof(VkDrawIndirectCommand|VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand))`
  **must** be less than or equal to the size of buffer
  - If `drawCount` is greater than 1, `(stride Ã— (drawCount - 1) + offset +
  sizeof(VkDrawIndirectCommand|VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand))` **must** be less
  than or equal to the size of buffer
  - If the `drawIndirectFirstInstance` feature is not enabled, all the
  `firstInstance` members of the
  `VkDrawIndirectCommand|VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` structures accessed by
  this command must be 0
  - `drawCount` **must** be less than or equal to
  VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxDrawIndirectCount
